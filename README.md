# ReCharge BCN

ReCharge BCN is a React project aimed at providing information on electric-motorbike vehicle charging stations in the city of Barcelona. The website displays the charging stations in both a list and a map view. It utilizes TypeScript and React for frontend development, with testing done using Vitest. Additional tools like ESLint, Git hooks workflows, SonarCloud, Netlify, and OpenLayers are integrated to ensure code quality, continuous integration, and project management.

## Features

- List view of electric vehicle charging stations in Barcelona.
- Map view of electric vehicle charging stations using OpenLayers.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **React**: An open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vitest**: A testing utility for Vite applications.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
- **Git Hooks Workflows**: Development strategy based on Git hooks for quality control and code reviews.
- **SonarCloud**: A cloud-based code quality and security service that continuously inspects code quality.
- **Netlify**: A web hosting and infrastructure services platform offering tools for web development, deployment, and management.
- **OpenLayers**: A high-performance, feature-packed library for creating interactive maps.
